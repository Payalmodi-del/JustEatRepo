Question:
1.	How long did you spend on the technical test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the technical test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
#Answer:
I spent an hour on the technical test. If I had more time, I would create separate feature files and step definition files for checking all the functionalities to eliminate repetitive steps in same class, which will help at the time of regression and integration testing. I would also add explicit wait. I also had written automation test to cover complex functionalities like using dropdown, Action class, and Java Script Executor class. I would perform cross browser testing with Firefox, IE and Safari as well.

3.	How would you implement test automation in a legacy application? Have you ever had to do this?
#Answer:
Legacy applications are already built and fairly popular applications which affect lots of users. When we are automating such applications we need some answers to define test strategy and get idea about the approach we will be taking. the questions include the area where client is currently experiencing the poorest quality, key areas of functionality which defines main objective of an application, the features which client thinks might make application of better quality and utility, the biggest risks to their systems, the thing client need to change (highest priority thing), if exploratory manual testing would find more crucial bugs etc.

Question:
4.	How would you improve the customer experience of the JUST EAT website?
#Answer:
The application is really slow. Load testing is the one area I would put my focus on. Also once the postcode is added and we are on the main page where we get to select popular cuisine, it is very confusing. Sometimes one cuisine is checked and we select another cuisine afterwards it just stays on earlier selection and we have to deselect and select again.
